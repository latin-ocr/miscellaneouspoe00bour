16 THE SONG OF THE THREE CHILDREN.

Lctffi ithful Abram's race their off'rings bring,

By tumsul David taught his praise to smg,
Their guide, their legissator, and their king :
who spread o'er Egypt's land substantial night,

Who with a longer sun did Joshua's saith requite.

ΥΕ priests of God, let praise like incense rise,

Tho' Corah's sons your order may despise,
And wiss1 the priest himself a sacrifice.

Praise him for others too, and thus commend

Your greatest en’mies to your only friend.

Praise him, his servants who have learnt to see,
There's nought so sweet as this captivity‚

From whence 'tis greatest bondage to be free.

Praise him, whose power can grant whate’er you move,

W hose ears will hear your prayerS, for heis love.

1 Ye
