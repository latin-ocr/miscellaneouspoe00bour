EPILOGUE TO IGNORAMUS,

Spoken by IGNORAMUS and DULMAN

IGNORAMUS
*a ww Auditores spe&atoresque benigni,

ἓξὲξ Ο all ye hearers & ye standers by3

Crede mihi dolet hoc munus mihi demandari· 3
The epilogue puts me in a great quandary:

My wit is at an end, my law is out.
Nescio quid dico, aut dico quod non ego noseo;
I know not what to say, 01· say not what Ι know.
Why truly-may it please you—I demurr 3
Memoria fine brief is never sure.

We, as We humbly do conceive, may move
These honourable benches, as above,

'That We may now be clients unto γους

’Tis not in form& pauperis we sue :
And as we in your judgment stand, that we

May likewise in your honour’s favour be, T} ‚
