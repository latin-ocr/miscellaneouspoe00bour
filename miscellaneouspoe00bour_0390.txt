In BARBADOS.

¹Sacred to the memory
of ANNE, the beloved wife
of Mr. DUDLEY WOODBRIDGE.

IF the remembrance of whate’er was dear
Deserves the pious tribute of a tear, }

Bestow it on the dust 'that sseepeth near:

T hat precious du-st, which living did comprise
The Fair‚ the Goed, the Graceful and the Wise.
Bestow a tear3 nor think thy sorrow lost,
Another, and another, should it eost:

The real worth of virtue ne’er is known,

Tau ravish’d from before our eyes, and gonew.

She died

oecober 5, MDccxxxm,
Aged xxxw.
