Should bring me back my guest again,
Again with mufick come prepar'd

Thy friendly host to entertain.

The sacred power of harmony

In this its best effe& appears,
That friendship in the striffiest bands

It both engages and endears.
In mufick's raviihing delights

You feather'd race with men agree ;
Of all the animated world

The only harmonifls are we.
