xo sslf. SONG OF THE THREE CHILDREN.

δί· homey dcws of May, like vapours rise,

Exhal'd in praises to your native ss<ie33

And hoary fsost, which o'er the meadow lies
Like ashes scatter'd by his bounteous hand,

Restoring vigour to the wearied land.

Praise him, γε frosts that bind the earth in chains,

Praise him, ye cold, that human force restrains‚

Dead’ning the sense, and thrilling in the veins.
His praise for ever be by you. extol'd‚

Inflam’d with ardours by th’ extream of eold.

Praise him, you frost, long as the frozen sea

In midst of storms enjoys a calm by thee ε

And spotless suow, the type of purity 3
In all your figur'd shapes his glory shew,

Forget not heaven above, when fall’n on earth below.
