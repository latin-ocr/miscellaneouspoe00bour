THE WREATH.

IX.
A little while
Your glories smile,

A little, little reign3
The sun, that warms
Your opening charms,

Ost sees them close again.

X,
Or if they stay
Another day,
And yet another sun3
Then comes a blaze
Of fiercer rays ;.
They wither and are gone.
XI.

A year consumes,
Another comes,

And then a new takes place ε,

Another new·
Shall then ensue,

Another new, to pass·

XII.
But, all the while,
Her beauties smile,
And tempt the lover's care:

3

A year
