of! Who ssmll inform me of that state, from whence
there is no return?

Surely there is a reward for the righteous ; the souls of
the faithful after they are delivered from the burthen of
the ssesh, are undoubtedly in joy and felie11y3 but then
where shall the ungodly and the smner appear? where
{hall ἶ, who have spent many years in idleness and Unity,
and {rave no merit of my own to plead for me! where
shall 1, who have not treasured up one good work to be-
speak the favour of the Almighty3 and have only the
suff-:rings of Jesus Christ, and those very sufferings often
fflighted, trampled on, and rejected by me, to offer in
ray behalf ?

But oh! may the goodness of God, if there be still
mercy left for me, while it is yet called to·day‚ before
the night cometh on, so affist me with his grace in work-
ing out my salmam, that neither the defire of life, nor
the dread of death, may withdraw my thoughts from
him? hut that, in this my day, l may confides the things
which make for my peace, before they are hid from my
eyes. In humble confidence thereof, and in full all'urance
of his most graeious mere}r to all returning firmem, Ι will
endeavour to fortir} and prepare myst-If against the terrers

of death.
