92, LUCYANDCOLIN.

ΙΙΙ.

'l'hrec times, all in the dead of night,
A boll was heard to ring;

And shrieking at her window thrice,
The raven flap'd his Wing.

'1¹00 well the love-loru maiden knew
The solemn boding found,

And thus, in dying word8‚ bespoke
The virgins weeping round.

IV.

1 hear a voice you cannot hear,
Which says,I must not stay3

Isee a hand you cannot see,
Which beckons me away.

By a false heart, and broken VOWS,
In early youth Ι die:
Am I to blame, because his bride

Is thrice as rich as 1?

V.

Ah, Colin! give not her thy Vows,
Vows due to me a‘lone3 Ι

Νοι· thou, fond maid, receive his kiss,
Nor think him all thy own.

To-morrow
