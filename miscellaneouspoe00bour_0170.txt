138 MEL1ss

And lets her quickly-ending days
Pass, and perish, as they pass.

The time that vulgar maids despist,
Careless‚ thoughtless, how it flies,

Melissa wife, esteems, and knows
Well to use it, ere it goes.

If e’er Melissh wed my friend,
With her ent'ring shall attend

Virtues and graces by her fide,
Eride-maids fit for such a bride:

Neat beauty without art display'd,
Rosy health with native red3

With her bright innocence shall go,
Purer than the falling snow:

Qiet, that far from quarrels flies ;
Mirth and pleasure, love and joys ε

Α.

Firm saith, that plighted promise keeps,

Silence watching o’er her lips z
Prudence, that ponders all events,
WVealth-increasmg diligence z

Religion, mlndful what is ow’d
To herself and to her God.
Patient to bear, to pardon free,
Loveliest grace humanity!

If ersing nature chance to fail,
Feeble, inadvertent‚ frail z
