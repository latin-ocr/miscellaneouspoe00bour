78 THEWISH.

XIV.
But if friends prove unfaithful, and fortune a c whose,
Stin may Ι be virtuous, though I am p00r3
My life then as useless, may I freely refigu,
When no longer Ι reliss] true wit and good wine.
May I govem See.
XV.

To outlive my d senses may it not be my fate,
To be blind, to be deaf, to know nothing at all ;
But rather let death come before ’tis so late,

And while there's some θ sap in it, may my f tree fall.
May I govern δῖε.

XVI.
I hope Ι shall have no occafion to send

For priests or phyficians‚ till I’m so near mine end,

g That Ι have eat all my bread‚ and drank my last glass 3

h Let them come then, and set their seals to my pass.
May I govern &c.

 

‘¹ May I not lose my sight, my hearing, and my memory, and be 3 burden to my
friends, and myself, “ Telluris inutile Pondus,’' 3 dead unuseful burden to the
ground.

 

Ultima semper

“ Expeetanda dies homini est, dicique beatus

“ Ante obitum nemo supremaque funera debet.'' Ovid.

⁸ If you tell an Italian, such a one is a rich, or happy man3 he‘n reply, “ Dammi
“ 10 morto,’' as much as to say, Let me see him dead, and then it will be evident
whether heis or not3 before that, no true judgment is to be made.
