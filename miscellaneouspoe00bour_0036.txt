8 THE SONG 01⁷ Tfrss THREE CHILDREN.

ἵε wind5‚ that where you please, your found may send,

In hymns of joy your pious breathings spend;

Oh! praise him without bound, and without end.
Who with majestic pomp, and terror join’d,

Rides chariotin g on clouds, and walks on wings of wind.

Ye flameS, exalt the universal choir ;
On zeal, bright as yourselves, to God aspire;
God a consuming, and a harmless fire:
WVhose falling fires Elijah’s foes could tame,
Who ssxone in Moses’ bush a lambent flame,

'Ye winter's chillness, and ye summer’s sun,
'That round the year in stated periods run,

Praise him in your eternal antiphon.

Who when the fatal flood of old was past,
Promis’d the seasons with the world should last,

Ye
