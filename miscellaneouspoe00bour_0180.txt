146 DEDICATION TO THE KING.

High on thy British throne, to mark from far,
And calm the billows of the rismg war;

To smooth the frowns on fair Europa's face,

And force rehustant nations to embrace.

As late the jarring winds, with mingled roar,
StruggIed to wxeck, yet wafted you to shore ε

So shall the storm, that threats your peaceful land,
Roll harmless o'er, or burst, where you command,
