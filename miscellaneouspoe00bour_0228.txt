THE F-ANATICst*

ἲ ,ὶέξκῦίζὲῐ-ΙΕΝ first to speak uprises Simon Pure,

fit& Silent he stands, with countenance demure3
iflff'gffughs, he spits, with many a hawk and hem,
To clear a way for wordS, and utter them:

His gloves beside him on the pulpit lie,

His two broad hands to heav'n are lifted high-3

W ith eye—lids shut he groan8‚ for, closely pent,
The murm'ring spirit struggles for a vent3

At length a voice breaks out beneath his hat,
Another, and another aster that:

But fair and soft, with frequent pauses mixt,

And many a figh‚ and many a groan betwixt 3

's ill by degrees he fans, with zealot* ire,

The dormant coals of Puritanie fire3

Arion, he starts, he bounds‚ on tip-toe standS,
Roars with his voice, and hammers with his hands 3
The strength of lungs he tries, he pants, he blows,

And down his cheeks the sweat profusely flows:
To ev'ry soul he threatens instant doom,

And a fanatie tempest ssiakes the room.
