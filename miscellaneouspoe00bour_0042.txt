¹4 THE. SONG OF 'I'HE THREE CHILDREN.
ἵε wells ancl streams, your source of moisture knoW‚
Wlm made, when urg’d of old his p0w⁷r to shew,
Forth ssom 111⁷ obedient rock the waters How·

Nor is the fountain of his praises ὼγ,

But unexhausted stores for-ever will supply&

Ye rivers, bear his praise to every land,

Praise him, γε seas, by whose supreme command

Your greatest rage is bounded by the sand.
No bounds or limits are affign'd you here,

NOI‘ Gan your UtmOst forces gO [00 far.

Praise him, ye whales, and all the filver tram,

Tlmt, on the fifth day made, the watery main
Within its spacious bosom does contain:
His praise‚ ye fifh, by you be alway sung,

Tho’ mute, to bless your Maker, find a tongue.

Praise
