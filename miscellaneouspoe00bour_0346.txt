294 PROLOGUE To IGNO'RAMUS.

An Igmwraums amongst all the smum,
Cn] not bc scen herc cv'ry day in ᾔτηη
None to the bar or to the bench pretends,
But hc that luws with eloquence defends.

 

Against the gown no evil we intend,

On them our glebe and future tithes depend ;

All we propose is to give some delight‚

A scholar-like diverfion for a night.

For at the ancient seat of learning, where

T his play first enter’d on a theatre‚ }
The gravest students deign’d to have a ssmre.

And twice, if Cambridge poets rightly fing,

Did Ignoramus entertain a king.

The charaezer his pleasant humour hit;
The king with gracious mirth had like to split- ζ

T here was another rhyme, but not so fit.
Our hopc is then, tho' black should {v v ’ “ ⁵
If less diverted‚ you'll go sweeter hom.
