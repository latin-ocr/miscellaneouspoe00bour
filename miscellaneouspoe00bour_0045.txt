THE SONG OF THE THREE CHILDREN.

Ye righteous souls, untainted with your clay,
Spring thro' the vast expanso and wing your way,
To reach the confines of eternal day.
Celestial anthems fing With seraphs join'd‚
And souls unbodied bless the ahnighty mind.

Ye lmmble men, whom self-admiring pride,

With all its baits could never draw afide, ,

Praise him, whose love does o'er the meek prefide.
Who throws the purple tyrants from their seat,
And makes the poor of spirit rich and great.

Ye Jewish youths, his wond'rous praises tell,
Whose presence could the raging flames repell 3

And turn to heaven the punishment of hell.
Who on submiffive fire triumphant rode,
The man affuming, to declare the God.

All glory‚ praise, dominion‚ majesty,
Now and for everlasting ages, be

To the effential one, and co-eternal three!
