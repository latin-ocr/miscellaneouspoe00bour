THE WREATH.

A year consumes, .
Another comes ;

And Phyllis still is fair.

XIII .
To all one date
Affigns not fate,
As plain, too plain, appears 3
Your glories live,
Days four or five,
But hers as many years.
XIV.
Yet, gentlest race,
Your fleeting grace
To blooming Phyllis lend τ
And, as you fade,
Remind the maid,

T hat years like days must end.
