ι] THE SONG OF THE THREE CHILDREN.
Be this your busmess, ye laborious days,

And filcnt nights fiivcr’d with glimmering says 3
Excmpt from every work, but that of praife.
Whose pierciug eye does equal power display

Iu darkest tuidnight, andin brighest day:

Praise him, o light, in heavenly beams array'd5
Parent of day, and first of beings, ssmde3
Praise him, who reign'd before the world was made3

who dwells in brightness and who rides in night,

Majestic darkness, and alluring light.

Ye clouds with sulphur charg'd‚ his Praise resound}

Loucler than thunder in your caverns bound;

Lighttslngss, th1t quickly die, and dying Wound,
Ere yet your momentary flash is done,

Praise him, whose lustre can be never gone.

Praist
