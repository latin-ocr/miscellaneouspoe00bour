„o COLIN’S COMPLAINT.

How foolish was I to btlieve,
She conid dont on so lowly a clown?
Or, that hez· fond heart would not gffleve,
To forsal-te the fine folk of the town?
To think that a beauty so gay,
So kind and so constant would prove3
Or go clad like our maidens in grey,
Or live in a cottztge on love Ρ

What tho' Ι have sszffl to complain!
Tho’ the mu⁸ses r‘ny temples have cnown'd [-
What tho', when they hear my soft strain,
The virgins fit weeping around!
Ah, Collo! thy hopes are in vain,
θ Thy pipe and thy laurei refign 3.
Thy false one inclines to a swain,
Whose music-is sweeter than thino.

And you my companions so deas,
Who sorrow to see me betray'd,

Whatever I suffer, sorbeas,
Forbear to accuse the false maidss

Tho’ through the wide world I should 1·ange‚..
’Tis in, vain from my fortune> to fly:

'Twas her's to be false :md to change3
'Tismine to be constantrand, diez. ‘
