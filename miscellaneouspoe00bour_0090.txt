ὀρ WILLIAM ΛΝΒ ΜᾸΑΚΟΑΚΕΤᾼ

XIV.

But hark! the Cock has warn’d me hence ι,
Α long ancl last adieu !'
Come sce, salse mani how low {he lies,
T hat died for love of you..
XV.
Now birds did fing, and morning smile„
And ssoew her glittering head:
Pale william shook in every limb,.
Then raving left his bedss
XVI.
He hied him to the fatal place
Where Margaret’s body lay,
And stretch'dvhim on the green grass' turf',
That wrapt her breathless clay,
XVII.

And thrice he cass’d' on Margaret’'s name,
And thrice he wept full sore;
Then laid hissseheek tothe cold earth,

And word spake never more.
