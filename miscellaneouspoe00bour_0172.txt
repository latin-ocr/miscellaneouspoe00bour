Who hates low—whisper'd spite conceal'd‚

Scandal yet to few reveal'd3
Since envy makes with rumour'd lies
Friends and brethren enemies.

Good- breeding shall her handmaid be,

Join’d with chast-look'd modesty ;
While open heart, and hand, and face,
Hospitality displays.
If e'er Meliffa grace your home,
These attendants with her come.
Whate'er can good or ill befall,
Faithful partner {he of all.
Whose wisdom, teaching well to bear,
Sooths the bitterness of care 3
Whose joy, if prosp’rous fate you meet,
Adds new sweetness to the sweet.
These ties will nuptia] love engage,
Down from youth to hoary age,
1f e⁷er Melifl'a, lovely spouse!
Life's companion! crown your vows0
Such, such a confort choose to used,

Worthy of your board and bed.
