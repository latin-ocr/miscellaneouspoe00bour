A LETTER FROM THE AUTHOR
To A YOUNG LADY.

{ww} Am just come from indulging a very pleafing me-

{mist} lancholy in a country church-yard‚ and paying

a respeetful vifit to the dead, of which I am one day to
encrease the number. As the solemn-ity and awfulness of
the place does instantly affe& the beholder, the solitude
and filence of it does equally dispose him to attention and
meditation: so that We no where find a more useful and
improving retirement. Every monument has its instruc*
tion, and every hilloek has its lefl'on of mortality.

Ι have, by this means, in a short space of time read
the history of the whole village3 and could tell the
names of its principal families, for the last thirty or forty
years: I might perhaps go a little higher3 but here, by
the injury of time and weather‚ the register begins to
be interrupted‚ and the letters are generally so defaced,
that if an inscription can be made out, it is not without

much difficulty and conjeemre.
