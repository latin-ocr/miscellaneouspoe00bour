May my g little house stand on the h fide ofa hill,
With an easy descent to a mead and a '¹ mill,
T hat when I’vc a mind I may hear my boy read,
In the mill ifit rain33 if it's dry, in the mead.
May I govcrn ἃς.

Near a shady k grove, and a murmuring brook,
With the ocean at ³ distance, whereon I may look,
With a spacious plain, without hedge or stile,
And an easy pad-nag to ride out a mile.

May Ι govern &c.

²³ Neither on the top nor the bott0m; the best situation for a house or a city,
affording both conveniency of cellars, and a descent to take off the waters.

ἰ lt will be thought the old man has made a very ill choice ofa Mill to hear his
boy read in; but they who make this objeciion, either know not, or at least do
not consuler, that noise helps deafness, which is incident to old age. That this is a
truth, both experience and reason evidence.

Ihave known several who could hear little or nothing in their chambers; but
when they were in a Coach rattling upon the stone3‚ heard very well. I also knew
a lady in Effex, whose name was Tyrrel, who, while she had occafion to discourse,
used to beat a greatdrum‚ without which she-could not hear at all; the reafon where-
of is this, the most frequent cause of deafness is the relaxation of the Tympanum
or dmm of the ear, which, by this violent and continual agitation of the air, is ex-

tended, and made more tight and springy, and better reflezsss sound5‚ like a Drum
new-braced.
