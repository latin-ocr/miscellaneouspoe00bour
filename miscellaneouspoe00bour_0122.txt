92 T W E E D-S I D E.

How does my love pass the long day?
Does Mary not tend a few sheep?

Do they never carelessly stray‚
While happily she lies asseep ?

Tweecl's murmurs should IUU her to rest,
Kind nature indul'ging my bliss 3

To relieve the soft pains of my breast,

l'd steal an ambrofial kiss.

’Tis {he does the virgins excell,
No beauty with her can compare3
Love's graces all round her do dwell3
She's fastest, where thousands are fair.
Say, charmes, where do thy flocks stray?
Oh! tell me, at noon where they feed ?
Shall I seek them on sweet—winding Tay,
Or the pleasanter banks of the T weed?
