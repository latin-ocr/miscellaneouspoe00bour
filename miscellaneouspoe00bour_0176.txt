1¹1„ DEDICATION TO THE KING.

From Thetis' flores, and not her neighbours’ spoils,
She ‹lfa-»vs her treasure, fruit of honest toils.

Rome szoek'd, and plunder'd3 Britain cloaths and feeds;
Acquires their siches, but supplies their needs.

Sweet seat of freedom Ι be thy happier doom,
To 'seape the fate, as well as guilt of Rome:
Where riou, offspring of unwieldy flore,

Enerv'd those arms, that snatch’d the spoil before ;
With costly cates she stain'd her frugal board,
Then with ill-gotten gold she bought a lord.

Corruption, discord‚ luxury combin⁷d,
Down sunk the far-fam’d mistress of mankind.

Hear, righteous prince! ο hear us loud invoke
Thy Worth unblemish’d‚ to avert this stroke:
Yourself so free from ev’ry lawless view,

You scarce admit the homage that is due.

Let other monarchS, with invafive bandS,

Leffen their people, and extend their lands 3

By gasping nations hated and obey’d‚

Lords of the deserts, that their sword has made3
For thee kind heav'n a nobler tass< defign'd,

To fix thy empire on thy people’s mind ; H· h
