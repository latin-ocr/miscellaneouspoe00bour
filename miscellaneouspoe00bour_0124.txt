LUCY AND COLIN.

I.
AF Lei nster, fam'd for maidens fai
(QKCC) Bright Lucy was the grace3
⁴ Nor e 'cr did Liffy' s limpid stream
Refle& so fair a face.
T ill luckless love, and pining care,
Impair'd 'her rosy hue,
Her coral lips, and damasi< cheeks‚
And eyes of gloffy blue.

Π.
Oh, have you seen a lily pale,

When beating mins descend?

‘So droop'd the ssow-consum'lng maid,
Her life now near it's end.

By Lucy warn'd‚ of flattering swains
Take heed, ye easy fair ε

Of vengeance due to broken vow5,
Ye perjur’d swzfins, bewate.
