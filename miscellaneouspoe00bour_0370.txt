A LETTER FROM THE AUTHOR

The proccffion may be long, and set off with 311 the
fincry that pride-can invent, or money 6311 purchase‘3
111 so much that women shall stand amazed‚ and children
111111 hold up 111611 hands with astonishment: yet 311 this
miclnight shew, which 1133 raised the curiofity of multi-
tudes, and with purposed delays 1133 increascd it 111101111-
patience, can go no sarther with him 111311 to 1113 grave3
here must all his state leave him, and the honours 316 1113

110 longer.

Having thus amused myself in contemplating the va-
nity of human greatness3 what is it, said Ι, that 6311 thus
make us startle, and shrink at the thoughts 01 death?
The mighty and the rich of the world may tremble, but

what 13 the sting of death to those, whose life has been
altogether misery? or ,what power has the grave over the

unhappy? is it not rather 3 refuge from violence and
>oppreffion‚ and a retreat from insolence and contempt?
13 it not 3 [11016ἇῖ1011 to the defenceless, and 3 security to
him who had no place to fiee unto ? Surely in death there
13 safety‚ and in the grave there is peace3 this wipes off
‘the sweat of the poor labouring man, and takes the load
from the bended back of the weary traveller: this dries
up the tears of the disconsolate, and maketh the heart of
-the sorrowful to forgct its throbbing3 ’tis this cases the
agonies of the diseased‚ and giveth 3 medicine to the hope-
less incurable : this discharges the naked and hungry in—

solvent 3
