HYMN THE SECOND.

IV.
Th'mk‚ O my foul, devoutly think,
How with affrighted eyes
Thou saw⁷st the wide-emended deep
In all its horrors rist l
V.
Confufion dwelt in every face,
And fear in every beart,

When waves on wavms, and gulphs in gulphs„

O’ercame the pilot's art.
VL
Yet then from all my grief8‚ o Lord,

Thy mercy set me free ;
While in the confidence of prayer
My foul took hold on thee.
VH.
For tho' in dreadful Whirls we hung,
High on the broken wave ;
1 knew thou west not ssow to hear'„

Nor impotem to save.

VIII.
T he storrn was laid, the winds rebir'd‚

ohedient to thy will ;
T he sea, that roar'd at thy command,

At thy command was still.
