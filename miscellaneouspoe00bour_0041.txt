Praise him, o earth, whilst thou thyself skalt last3
Thy solid orb in liquid aether plac'd‚

Tho' hung on nothing, is for-ever fast:
Praise him whose being is sustain'd by none ;

Himself is centre of himself alone.

Ye mounts and hius, crown'd with a pompous load
Of groves5 where idols plac'd their old abode,
Resound the praises of a real God.

W ho ss1ew’d his goodness, who proclam'd his will

On Horeb's mountain, and on Sina's hill.

Praise him, ye greens, by fruitful nature born,

And rismg crops that plenteous vales adom

Where zephyrs rustle thro’ the Wavy corn ;

Who cloaths in greater state each springing green

Than that which dreW from far the southern queen.

Ye
