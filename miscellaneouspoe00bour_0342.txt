290 EPILOGUE TO THE ADELPHI.

Old as I was, I am3 whate’er they say,

Grcy were my locks before, and still are grey.

No strutting hoop my dangling clothes bears out,
Red was, and red remains, my petticoat.

My old wife’s trinkets still hang jingling down,
The same the nodding of my steeple crown.

 

My pulse beats ssow and dull, my teeth are gone,
Not one colt’s tooth is left, not half a one.

I-Iair thinly seattered on my cheek there groWS‚
Where bloom’d the lily once, where blush’d the rose.

Nor yet accuse I Fate‚ or ra'il at Time,

 

VVhose stealing years have spoil'd my former prime.
Your powerful smiles can gladsom youth restore3
If you applaud her, nurse is old no more..
