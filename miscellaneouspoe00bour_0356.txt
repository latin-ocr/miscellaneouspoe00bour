354 EPILOGUE TO HARRY THE FOURTH.

lf in the street a civil dun should come3

Pray come to—mor1·ow‚ and—-I'll be from home.
If in the hall a number should appear,

My Lord's asseep‚ Sir, in his elbow chair.

When tradesmen grow impatient for their due,
&Tis so long standing-*never talk of't—’pshewl }

I've good preferment in my eye for you.

For sempstress Doll, How doth Miss Prue? poor fooll
I'll pay for⁷t‚ send her to the dancing school.

If 1 like pagan gods my [hape could vary,

My guts should be a hogshead of Canary.

My bowels tapt should suckle thirsty man,

I'd seed my younkers like a Pelican.

Say what you will, t'would be immortal glory3
’Tis jocund thinking, and l’ll end my story.

But that my equipage I sadly lack,
To cry before me, Room there, pray bear back, Ι
By your leave, pray make room for Noble Jack.
