98 LUCYANDCOLI

To-morrow in the church to wed,
Impatient, both prepare3

But know, fond maid3 and know, false man,

That Lucy will be there.
VI.

There bear my corse, ye comrades‚ bear,
The bridegroom blith to meet 3

He in his wedding-trim so gay,
I in my winding—sheet.

She spoke‚ she died 3———her corse was born,
The bridegroom blith to meet3

H'e in his wedding-trim so gay,.
She in her winding-ssoeet.

VH.

T hen what were perj‘ur'd‘ Colin-'s thoughts?
How were those nuptials kept?

The bridemenflock’d- round Lucy dea-d,
And all the village xvept..

Compaffion, Shame, Remorse, Despair„
At once his bosom swell 3

The damps of death bedew'd his brows,.
He shook, he gromsd, he fell.
