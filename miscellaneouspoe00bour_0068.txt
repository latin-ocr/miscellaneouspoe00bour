33 οἷκ- ALL SA1NTs DAY.

Ye propliets, who with ardent zeal
And knowledge heavenly poffest,
To future ages did reveal
The secrets of Jehovah’s breast3
'Twas you, enlighten'd from above,
Foresaw ancl told that God was love.

You were the church's best defence,
Ye martyrs now enthron'd on high,

Bravely secure in innocenee,
And boldly resolute to die 3
Daring (so firmly ye Withstood)

In spite of malice to be good.

Go on, ye hosts and armies bright, ⁷
Your voices, all ye saints, to raise;
Go on, ye glorious sons of light,

Your God and mighty King to praise:

While yearly we do here below
Acknowledge‚ What to you we owe.
