THE SONG OF THE THREE
CHILDREN.

»ᾀὲξῆ HATE'ER God’s fiat did from nothing raise,

»ffgffw Stupendous prod-u& of the first fix days,
O bless your Mzzker, your Creator praise.
· In this let jarring elementgs agree,v

Or make from discord sweetest harmony.

Ye sons of light made by his power ἀᾷγίηες
By his resse&ed beams it is you shine3
Your hallelujahs 'm the chorus join,

That far as creatures can your praise may prove

Great as his power, and endless as his love.

Praise
