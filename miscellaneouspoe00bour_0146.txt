Yet will I never set thee free;

For haim was meant, and hai-m to me.

Vain fecii-s that vex thy virgin heart Ξ·

l‘ll give thee up my bow and dart:
Untangle but this cruel chain,
And freely let me fly again.

Agreed! secure my virgin heart3·
Instant give up thy bow and dart:
The chain l'll in return untie ;

And freely thou again [halt fl'y.
Thus she the captive did deliver3
The captive thus gave up his quiver.

The God disarm'd‚ e'er fince-that day,

Paffes his life in harmless play 3
Flies round, or fits upon her breast,
A little, flutt'ring‚ idle guest„

E'er fince that day, the beauteous maid,

Governs the world in Cupid's stead,

Direeks his arrows‚ as she wills;
Gives grief or pleasure‚ spares or kinsi
