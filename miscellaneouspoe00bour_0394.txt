Here lies
JOHN ARCHER Esq3 doctor of physick‚
one of his majesty's justices of the peace
for the county of VVestmoreland 3 who
departed this life the 4th of December, MDccxxxv.
He was a worthy man, a sszilful phyfician‚
An impartial magistrate, and an amiable friend:
His mind was generous, his temper sweet,
His understanding extensive 3
In nature he was compaffionate‚
In virtue severe.
He adorned the reasonable being
With the dignity of morality ;
The true christian,
With the saneti& 'of religion.
He was a delight to his acquaintance,
An honour to his profeffion,
And an happiness to his country.

Dear and defireable is the memory of Dr. Archer,
Cruel and lamentable is the loss of him:
Every eye overflows with team,

Every breast is filled with sorrow,

And every house is become,

The house of mourning.
