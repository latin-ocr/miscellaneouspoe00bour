EPILOGUE TO THE ADELPHI,

Spoken by CANTHARA,
E N G L I S H E D.

33.3²‘··³33²²‘'·3³²'·³3.3ffi3.OOR nurse is sent to bid you all good b'ye,
Ρ A plain, but neat and tight old woman I,
'²⁸⁸³¹'33²''³'· (Except what should excepted be you know)
A very meer old trot from top to toe.
But come, dear Faustus, try enchantments here,
And make e'en me a blooming maid appear3
To look with beauty‚ and to move with ease,
Ananieely taught a thousand ways to please.
[ She waves a wand.
Speak, do long lappets wanton wave in air,
Does the strait cawl press down my auburn hair?
Are patches rang'd of large and smaller fize?
Bate to my snowy chest, say, does my bosom rise?
My spreading hoop raise stiff it’s ampler sphere‚
A sevenfold arch, an amphitheatre ?
Ahl conjuret Faustus, vain thy wand and skill,
Nor are old women witches when they will.
[ She breaks the wand-
Old
