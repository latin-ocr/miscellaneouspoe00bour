74 THE w1sH.

VIII.
Let the Gods, who dispose of every King’s eroum,
Whomsoever they please, set up and pull down;
I’ll pay the whole ffiilling impos'd on my head,
Tho' I go without w Claret that night to my bed.
May Ι govern δῖε.
ΙΧ.
I'll bleed without grumbling though x that tax ssiould
appear
As oft as new Moom, or weeks in a year.
For why should Ι let a seditious word fall,
y Since my lands in z Utopia pay nothing at all ?
Ι May Ι govern &a
X.
Tho’ Ι care not for riches‚ may I not be so poor,
That the rich without ffiame cannot enter my door 3
³ May they court my converse, may they take much
delight
My old stories to hear in a winter’s long night.
May Ι govern &a

'¹' If that should happen‚ it would be a shrewd afflifiion to the Poet.
Χ Α Poll-bill.

Υ Α good encouragement to pay for his head.

² A place in Jupiter, or the Moon, or some other of the planets3 for it is not to
be found in the map of the world.
