THE SONG OF THE THREE CHILDREN.

Praise him, ye fowls, exalt his name, Whate’er
Or ss<ims the water, or divides the air,
Who cloaths and feeds you with paternal care.

Repeat his Praise to every echoing dale,

Ye morning lark, and evening nightingale.

Praise him, ye beasts that shady forests sway,

Who feeds the lions roaring for their prey,

Ye tamer kinds that human force obey,

Present your praise, more grateful to the sszies

Than thousands of you ssain in sacrifice.

Adore‚ ye sons of men, his awful name,

Tho' form'd of earth fill’d with etherial flame,

Cast in the noblest, and the finest frame.

Let lordly man his sovereign's praise declam,

And beauteous woman bless the truly fair.
