'114 LOVEDISARM'D..

Still lay the God: the nymph surpriz'd,

Yet mistress of herself, devis’d,
How she the vagrant might enthrall ;
And captive him, who captives all.

Her boddice half-way she unlac’d ε

About his arms [he ssily cast
The filken bond, and held him fast.

The God awak'd 3 and thrice in vain
He strove to break the cruel chain:
And thrice in vain he shook his wing,
Incumber’d in the filken string.

Flutt'ring the G0d‚ and weeping said2
Pity poor Cupid, generous maid,
Who happersd, being blind, to stray,
And on thy bosom lost his way:
W ho stmy’d, alaS, but knew too well,‚
He never there must hope to dwell.
Set an unhappy pris’ner free,
Who ne’er intended harm to thee.

To me pertains not, she replies,
To know or care where Cupid flies 3
What are his hamus, or Which his way3·

Where he would dwell‚ or whither stray z,
