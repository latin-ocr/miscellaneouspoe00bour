WILLIAM AND MARGARET.

IV.

'Her bloom was like the springing flower‚

Thac fips the filvcr dcxv3
'she rose was buddcd in her check,

And opening to the view.

V.
But love had, like the canker-Worm‚

Con sum'd her early prime :

ΊἬΕ rose grew pale, and left her cheek ;

She dy'd before her time.
VI.

Awake, {he eried, thy true love calls,
Come from her midnight grave3

Now let thy pi-ty hear the maid,

Thy love refus'd to save.
VII.

This is the dark and fearful honr,
When injur’d ghosts complain 3

Now dreary graves give up their dead,

To haunt the faithless swain.
VIII.
Eethink thee, William, of thy fault,
'shy pledge, and broken oath ;
,find give me back my maiden-vow‚
And give me back my troth.
