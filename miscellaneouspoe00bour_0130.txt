1001,UCYANDCOLIN.

VIII.

From the vain bride, (ab bride ιω more ἶ)
'she vas> ing csimson fl2d3

When, stretch'd before her rival's corso,
She saw her husband dead.

He to his Lucy's new made gram c,
Convcy'd with trembling swahm,

One mould with her, beneath one sod,
For ever now remains.

IX.
Ost at this grave, the constant hind
And plighted maid are seen3
With garlands gay, and true—Iove know,
They deck the sacred green.
But, swain forsworn, whoe'er thou art„
This hallow'd spot forbear;
Remember Colin’s dreadful fate„
And sear to meet him there..
