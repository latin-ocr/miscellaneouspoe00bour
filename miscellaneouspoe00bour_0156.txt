THE WREATII.

ΙΙ.

Ye roses come,

With virgin-bloom,

The pride of gardens o-Wn'd3

That from your ÷bed
Diffufive shed

Ambrofial odours round„
III.
Ye violets too,
In fields that grow,

And drink the vernal deW3
That dash the woods,
The meads, the floods,

With drops of purple hue.

IV.
And all ye flowers,
Whose wilder stores

O’er nature's face are seen3

'Whose various dye‘s

Promiscuous fise,

And paint th' enamel'd green⁴

3⁷.

Come, herbs, all γε
That tempt the bee
From leaf to leaf to roam 3
