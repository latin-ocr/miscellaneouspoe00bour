4 THE SONG OF THE THREE CHILDREN.

Praise him, γε heavenS, long as your frame shall last,

W ho like a curtain spread the azure waste,
And in your happy realms his throne has plac’d:
His utmost splendour still to you appears 3

Ο tune in praise the rnufick of your spheres.

Waters‚ that by the Almighty plac'd above,
Fixt as your firmament for-ever prove ε
Praise him whose spirit did on the waters move3
Who made you free from winds and storms below3

Whose praise can never ebb‚ nor -ever flow.

Thrones, potentates, dominions, powers on high,

Acknowledge your superior in the sky 3
And bless the universal Majesty.

Whose word's omnipotent‚ whose Willis fate,

The only powerful‚ and the only great.

Praise
