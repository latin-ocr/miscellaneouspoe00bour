Transsated by ΜΓ. S. WESLEY.

νέιᾷεᾲ) F, friend, a wife you mean to wed,

ζὴ, ἐξ Worthy of your board ancl bed, ²)

That she be virtuous, be your care,
Not too rich, and not too fair:
One who nor labours to display
New complexions every day,
Nor, studying artificial grace,
Out of boxes culls a face.

Nor live-long hours for dreffing spares,
Placing to displace her hairs,
And straight replace 3 an idle pin
Ten times shifting out and in.

Nor daily varies, vainly nice,

Thrice her filks, and colours thrice:

Fond o'er and o'er her suits to range,

Changing still, and still to change.

Nor
