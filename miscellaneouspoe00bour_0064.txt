Soon as the evening shades prevailj
The moon takes up the wond'rous tale,
And nighdy, to the listening earth,
Repeats the story of her birth:

Whilst all the stars, that round her burn,
And all the planets in their turn,
Confirm the tidings, as they roll,

And spread the truth from pole to pole.

What though, in solemnldljehce2 all

Move round this dark terrestrial, bau?
What though nor real voice nor found
Amidst their radiant orbs be found?
In reason's ear they all rejoice‚

And utter forth a glorious voice,

For ever finging as they ffiine,
“ The hand that made us is divine.''
