Ξῖἶὲϊίηὲ Chloe went: 1116 lost 1161 way,

And th1ough the woods uncertain chanc' d to stray.
Apollo pasfing by beheld the maid;

And, Sister dear, bright Cynthia, turn, he said5
The hunred hind lies close in yonder brake.
Loud Cupid laugh’d‚ to see the God’s mistake:
And laughing cried‚ Learn better, great divine,

To know thy kindred‚ and to honour mine.

Rightly advis’d, far hence thy fister seek,

Or on Meander's banks, or Latmus’ peak.

But in this nymph, my friend, my fister know; ,
She draws my arrows, and she bends my bow.

Fa'rr Thames 1116 haunts, and every neighb’rIng grove
Sacred to soft recess‚ and gentle love.

Go,
