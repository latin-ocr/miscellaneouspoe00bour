HYMN THE THIRD,

When thom, o Lord‚ shalltnstand disclos“d
In majesty severe!
And fit in judgment on my foul,

O! how shall I appear!

IV.
But thou hast told the troubled foul,
Who does her fins samem,
The timely tribute of her tears
Shall endless woe prevent.
V.
T hen see the sorrows of my beart,
Ere yet it be too late,
And hear my Saviour's dying groanS,
To give those sorrows Weight.

For never shall my soul dexsissir

Her pardon to procure3

who knows thy only> Son has dy’d,
To make that pardon sure.
