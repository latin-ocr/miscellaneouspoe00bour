146 D1⁴3D1CATION TO THE KING.

High on thy ssritish throne, to mark from far,
And calm thc- billows of the rifing war3

To smooth the frowns on fair Europa's face,

And sorec relucstant nations to embrace.

As late the jarring winds, with mingled soar,
Struggch to Wreck, yet wasted you to ssmre:

So shall the storm, that threats your peaeesul land,

Roll harmless o'er, or burst, where you command⁹
