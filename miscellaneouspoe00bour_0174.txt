DEDICATION

Prefixed to
TABLES of ancient COINS‚ WEIGHTS and MEASURES;
In the YEAR 1727·

By Mr. CHARLES ARBUTHNOT,
Student of Christ-Church‚ Oxford.

To the KING.

{³535} REAT name * ,which 1n our rolls recmded stands,
Ξ 3211 Leads‚ honours, and protefflz the learned bands,

Accept this offering to thy bounty due,

And Roman wealth m English sterling view.
Read here, how Britain, once despis'd, can raise
As ample sums, as Rome in Caesar’s days;
Pour forth as numerous legions on the plain,
And with more dreadful navies awe the main:

Tho‘ shorter lines her fix'd dominions bind,
Her floating empire stretches unconfin’d.

''v“ The King’s name stands first in the buttery-Book of Christ-Church College.
